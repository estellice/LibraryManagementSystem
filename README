## Object-Oriented Principles Applied

- **Encapsulation**  
  Each entity exposes only necessary properties and behaviors.

- **Abstraction**  
  Service and Repository interfaces hide implementation details.

- **Inheritance**  
  Common base entities and shared logic are reused.

- **Polymorphism**  
  Interfaces allow multiple implementations and flexible dependency injection.

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**  
  Controllers, Services, Repositories, and Domain Models each handle one responsibility.
